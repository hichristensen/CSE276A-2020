  <h2>Introduction to Robotics</h2>
  
  <p><br />
  Fall 2020, T-Th 3:30-4:50 PM, @ Zoom <br />
  Professor: Henrik I Christensen, Office hours: Thursdays 9-11<br />
  TAs: XXX - XXX@eng.ucsd.edu</p>
  
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  
  <p>This is an introductory graduate class so a minimum of formal
  requirements are assumed beyond an ability to program.</p>
  
  <h2>Piazza</h2>
  
  <p>We will be using Piazza for class communication/discussions, so
  you should get an enrollment email from them. Please do sign up and
  check it out.  The URL for the Piazza site is
  <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kffoz2m3dtj7be">here</a></p>
  
  <h2>Emailing about the class:</h2>
  
  <p>Please use piazza as much as possible, but if you must email me,
  please be sure to use "CSE276A" in the subject line, automatically
  done by clicking this link: <a
  href="mailto:hichristensen@ucsd.edu?subject=CSE276A">hichristensen@ucsd.edu</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Class Goals</h2>
  
  <p>The desired learning outcomes for the students are:</p>
  
  <ul>	
    <li>Understanding basic and advanced concepts in robotics</li>
    <li>Understanding the most common techniques used in the field</li>
    <li>Applying them on one or more robotic platforms/simulations and gain experience</li>
    <li>Interacting with your peers about the material, polls, quizzes, and assignments</li>
    <li>Evaluating your own progress in the course on a regular basis</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Textbook</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Robotics, Vision &amp; Control, Peter Corke, Springer Verlag. (see its
    <a href="http://www.petercorke.com/RVC/index.php">webpage</a> for links)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Assignments (20% each)</h2>

  <p>There will be five assignments, spaced throughout the quarter,
    each covering different aspects of robotics. We will use Canvas
    for submission of assignments. The CANVAS site is
    <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/18899">here</a> <br /> <br /> </p>

  <p> We will decide in the first week the best platform to use based on a class
    survey taking into account computer platform, access, and prior experience.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Participation in Class:</h2>

  <p>To encourage interaction, there is a 5% participation grade,
  allowing to get up to 5% extra credit for engaging in class dialogue
  and on Piazza (e.g., answering each others questions, asking
  questions).</p>
  
  <h2>Collaboration Policy:</h2>
  
  <p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged at the "white board"
  level. That is, share ideas and technical conversation, but write
  your own code. Students are expected to abide by the Honor
  Code. Honest and ethical behavior is expected at all times. All
  incidents of suspected dishonesty will be reported to and handled by
  the Dean of Students. </p>

  <h2>Late Policy:</h2>
  
  <p>1 day late: 75% of the grade, 2 days late: 50% of the grade,
  later than that: 0% of the grade. It is always permissible to ask
  prior approval to hand in an assignment late because of special
  circumstances.</p>

  <h2>Grading:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Assignments: 100% </li>
    <li>Participation Grade: 5% Extra Credit</li>
  </ul>
